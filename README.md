# Guess-my-number
Project 1 for practice


I made this project as a means of practicing JavaScipt. It works with basic functionality which was quite difficult to wrap my head around in the beginning. Not from an understanding standpoint but mostly from a HOW-THE-FUCK-DO-I-START-WRITING-THIS-CODE standpoint. 

If you are having a difficult time figuring how to start writing code, I've found that breaking a problem into smaller problem works the best. Do not worry if your code looks messy in the beginning. You can always refactor your code later. ðŸ˜¬
